  2022-06-30T15:31:00.000Z

  2022-07-27T15:00:00.000Z

  Gray's Inn is one of the four Inns of Court responsible for calling barristers to the Bar of England and Wales and its members are students, barristers and judges. It has a substantial commercial and residential estate and provides library and dining facilities, scholarships, training and other amenities for students and barristers. The Inn also contributes to the development of policy and comments on proposals affecting the profession. The Inn is seeking a Director of Education to cover the following areas:
  * Education and training. The scheduling, resourcing and operational management of the Inn's education events programme for trainee barristers, and those in the early years of practice, in specific aspects of the profession. The trainers at these events are generally experienced barristers or judges who are members of the Inn providing their services pro bono. The Director of Education works closely with experienced trainers to develop the programme and the Inn's pool of trainers.
  * Outreach and scholarships. Running a program to ensure that students (both at school and university) are aware of the opportunities afforded by the Bar and Gray's Inn to prospective barristers and the subsequent recruitment of student members to the Inn. Also to lead all operational aspects of the Inn's Scholarships program, which currently allocates £1.3m pa to trainee barristers.
  * Member services. Member services include management of the regulatory process to enable members who have satisfied the necessary academic and good conduct requirements to be called to the Bar.
  * Careers services. The provision of careers advice and guidance to students and barristers based in London and the Circuits. The provision of services such as pupillage application advice, mock interviews and the management of a mentoring service provides valuable support to the Inn's student membership and those in the early years of practice.
  * Policy issues. Consideration of policy issues will be required, often through liaison with third parties such as the Bar Council, The Bar Standards Board, the other Inns and the Council of the Inns of Court.

  The Requirements:
  * An energetic leader and experienced senior manager with outstanding organizational skills and a positive attitude.
  * Possessing the experience and gravitas to represent the Inn in senior policy forums.
  * Excellent interpersonal skills and the skill for enabling productive collaboration across varying departments and members of the Inn.
  * Willingness to work at weekends and evenings when required as that is when some of the education program is delivered.
  * Requires routine in-person attendance.
  * Proven capacity to manage all operational aspects of a complex training and education programme.
  * Experience of programme management within a regulated environment or profession.
  * Experience of student engagement and outreach.
  * Capacity to organize and influence teams of people without having direct line management authority.
  * Empathy for students who are at a critical stage in their professional training.

  Please apply by visiting our website via the button below assignment-briefings and following the instructions in the candidate brief quoting reference Y0602. The closing date is 4pm on 27 July.

  LONDON BOROUGH OF LEWISHAM

  2022-06-30T15:26:00.000Z

  2022-07-10T22:59:00.000Z

  Lead the team raising standards in Lewisham's private rented sector

  The role

  You will be one of two licensing and enforcement managers, leading Lewisham Council's growing landlord licensing and enforcement team. Lewisham is London Borough of Culture 2022. The council is a busy, exciting and challenging place to work, and is in the middle of an ambitious transformation programme. The Private Sector Housing team has recently launched a new borough-wide additional licensing scheme to license all Houses in Multiple Occupation in Lewisham, and has consulted on the introduction of a large selective licensing scheme to cover sixteen out of eighteen wards. This challenging programme of work will require you to manage an expanding team, including undertaking recruitment, training and performance management.

  You will also be supporting the Head of Service to design and implement:
  * effective new strategies for enforcement of standards in private sector housing
  * improvements to resident engagement and support for private renters
  * service design improvements to deliver efficiencies and maximise income

  Location
  Laurence House, Catford.

  Whilst the service is primarily based in Laurence House, we operate a hybrid approach whereby you may be required to work both in the office and from home as determined by service requirements.

  What we're looking for
  Lewisham's diversity is its biggest asset and we strive to ensure our workforce reflects the borough's diversity at all levels. We welcome applications from everyone regardless of age, gender, gender identity, gender expression, ethnicity, sexual orientation, faith or disability. We particularly encourage applications from Black, Asian and Minority ethnic candidates and disabled candidates, who are under-represented in our workforce.

  You will be passionate about improving services for vulnerable residents, highly organised and focussed on effective performance management of both teams and individuals. You will have a proven track record of delivering complex projects or initiatives, managing a mixed workload, and/or managing multi-disciplinary teams, and a strong understanding of local government.

  You will have a strong understanding of the legislative framework that governs property licensing, HHSRS, HMO management regulations and private sector housing enforcement more broadly. Experience of licensing and private sector housing enforcement at local government level is strongly desirable but not essential. We want to understand how your skills and experience are relevant to this work, regardless of your professional background. So please submit a supporting statement that uses specific examples to demonstrate how you meet the shortlisting criteria from the job description and person specification.

  In return, we'll offer excellent development opportunities, plus a range of benefits that includes a career average pension scheme, flexible working and the opportunity to make a real difference to our local community.

  Salary details
  £47,352 - £49,428 (Grade PO5) per annum

  N.B: All appointments will be offered at the minimum spinal column point (SCP) for the grade of the role. The only exception to this will be when matching current salary (up to the maximum of the scale), which is subject to evidential proof.

  Further information
  For an informal discussion, please contact Rhona Brown, Head of Private Sector Housing and Home Improvement: rhona.brown@lewisham.gov.uk, 07827256143</full_text>
